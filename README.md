This project proposes an artificially intelligent book recommendation platform. It was done in a group of 3 people along with a supervising faculty member. The research paper written on the topic was published at the 8th International Conference on Software and Computer Applications(ICSCA) 2019, held in Penang, Malaysia.

BookCeption is a proposed web-based book recommendation system that will allow readers to browse and buy books across multiple platforms at the most affordable price. It fetches data from E-commerce sites like Barnes and Nobles, Amazon, eBay along with Facebook pages and retail bookstore websites. It is a unique book recommender that uses Machine Learning techniques to recommend books as well as offers from other platforms to the registered users. This paper introduces the architecture of the proposed framework, which integrates the book recommendation system with a platform for buying books. For the book recommender discussed here, four different recommendation techniques were used- SVD, Co-clustering, NMF and Deep Learning to determine the best one for the framework.
